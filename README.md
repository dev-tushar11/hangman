# Hangman

## Welcome to my HANGMAN game !!

It is a simple interactive commandline Hangman game build using Python. It has a word collection of **55909** unique words.

### Details:
1. At the beginning of the game Computer will set a **Secretword** of n lengths from possible 55909 words in **word.txt**.
2. User will be told how many letters the **Secretword** contains.
3. User has to guess the **Secretword** in **8 guesses**.
4. User can guess only **1 letter** per guess.
5. User will get a immediate feedback about their last guess.
6. After each guess, the partially guessed word so far will be displayed, as well as letters that the user has not yet guessed.
7. User can not guess unavailable letters i.e. already guessed letters.
8. Game will end if User ran out of guesses or User guesses the correct word and the User will receive a message accordingly.

## Hope you enjoy the game :)
