# Hangman

## Welcome to my HANGMAN game !!

It is a simple interactive commandline Hangman game build using Python. It has a word collection of **55909** unique words.

### Details:
- At the beginning of the game Computer will set a **Secretword** of n lengths from possible 55909 words in **word.txt**.
- User will be told how many letters the **Secretword** contains.
- User has to guess the **Secretword** in **8 guesses**.
- User can guess only **1 letter** per guess.
- User will get a immediate feedback about their last guess.
- After each guess, the partially guessed word so far will be displayed, as well as letters that the user has not yet guessed.
- User can not guess unavailable letters i.e. already guessed letters.
- Game will end if User ran out of guesses or User guesses the correct word and the User will receive a message accordingly.

## Hope you enjoy the game :)
